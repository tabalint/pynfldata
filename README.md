Data extraction, cleaning, and verification from NFL's feeds-rs data service

## Scope
This project aims to provide data from the NFL's feeds-rs data service to BigQuery in a publicly-available dataset. 
This is intended to be done gradually in order to verify that all of the data is correct before insertion.
The first release is basic bulk data from every drive. Next will include the same types of data with plays additionally nested.
